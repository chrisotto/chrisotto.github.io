      <h1 class="attention">AT&amp;T Sucks</h1>
      <p>Apparently, AT&amp;T has decided to stop subsidizing iPhones, and the only options available are over $20/mo. more expensive than they used to be (at least for me).</p>
      <p>Here is a picture of the shiny new iPhone 6s in Space Gray:</p>

      <h2>Another unhappy customer</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.topix.com/forum/city/piedmont-mo/TLQ141P8KLLN9GEEM">Here's the website of another unhappy customer.</a>  This site is good because it is clear and to the point.  It is also good because it links to a followup article, "<a href="http://benmorrison.org/att-sux-so-hard/">AT&amp;T SUX SO HARD</a>".  It's also prettier than mine.  But it is a blog apparently built on Wordpress (because there are references to <code>wp</code> in the code) instead of a dedicated website like mine.  I think it is better to have a dedicated website to emphasize the importance of this issue.  Having a dedicated website allows me to invite visitors to join my boycott by adding their name to the list of AT&amp;T boycotters.</p>
